## 💡 Key Insights Highlighted

- 📍 **Sales vs. Profit**: Some high-sales products are actually unprofitable due to aggressive discounting.
- 🌎 **Regional Breakdown**: The **West** region outperforms in both sales and profit, while **South** lags behind.
- 🛋️ **Category Drilldown**: **Technology** drives the highest profit margins; **Furniture** needs margin optimization.
- 📉 **Loss Leaders**: Certain products consistently sell at a loss—worth investigating pricing or supplier contracts.
